            We provide a digital platform that connects qualified fire door surveyors and
            inspectors with potential clients and business opportunities. The service operates
            as a network and directory where professionals (“Affiliates”) can create profiles,
            submit credentials, and showcase their experience, coverage areas, and
            certifications.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            Our platform enables Affiliates to apply for inclusion, undergo a verification
            process, and, if approved, be listed in a public directory accessible to users
            seeking fire door inspection and surveying services. The platform also allows users
            to search for Affiliates based on location and other criteria, and to contact them
            directly for potential work opportunities.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            We act solely as an intermediary platform and do not provide fire door inspection
            services directly. We do not guarantee the quality, accuracy, or legality of
            services provided by Affiliates. Affiliates are independent professionals
            responsible for maintaining their own certifications, insurance, and compliance
            with applicable laws and industry standards.
